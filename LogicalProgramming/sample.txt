Names of character streams typically end with Reader/Writer and names of byte streams end with InputStream/OutputStream
The streams used in example codes are unbuffered streams and less efficient. We typically use them with buffered readers/writers 
for efficiency. We will soon be discussing use BufferedReader/BufferedWriter (for character stream) and BufferedInputStream/BufferedOutputStream 
(for byte stream) classes.It is always recommended to close the stream if it is no longer in use. This ensures that the streams wonâ€™t be
affected if any error occurs.The above codes may not run in online compilers as files may not exist.
